## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Customize the HTML and Sass files according to your requirements.
4. Compile the Sass code into CSS (if necessary) using a Sass compiler or build tool.

   - If you don't have Sass installed on your system, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

     ```
     npm install -g sass
     ```

   - Once Sass is installed, you can use the following command to compile your Sass files:

     ```
     sass --watch sass/style.scss:css/style.css
     ```

   This command will watch for changes in the `style.scss` file inside the `sass` folder and compile it into CSS, generating the `style.css` file inside the `css` folder.

5. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the landing page.

By following these steps, you'll be able to customize the project, compile the Sass code (if necessary), and view the landing page in your web browser.
